        "Language models are machine learning models that power some of the most impressive applications involving text and language (e.g. machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, summarization). At the time of this writing, some of the largest ML models in existence are language models. They are also based on the [transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) architecture. The transformer language model (TransformerLM) is a simpler [variation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf) of the original transformer architecture and is useful for plenty of tasks.\n",
